2009-08-10  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Added ability to call remove on a variable at global DDS level or within a Structure.  Ticket #1352.

	Ticket #1351: new rejection tests.

2009-08-07  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	Ticket #1351:  Added ability to create new scalar variables of simple atomic types.

	testsuite.at: Added support for testing against a getdap ascii version of a dods response for easier human verification of baseline data for new variables.

2009-08-05  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	testsuite.at: added ability to specify constraint expressions in autotest check macros

	variable_rename.at: repository for variable@orgName tests, included in testsuite.at

	Added new tests on variable rename for Structure and with constraints applied to renamed variable.

2009-08-04  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	VariableElement.cc, NCMLParser.cc, NCMLUtil.cc:  added support for renaming variables with variable@orgName (#1349).

	Added new Autotest testsuite in tests/ directory (#1348).

2009-07-31  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>

	* Added ability for NCMLParser to handle handle DataDDS request as well as DDX to support addition of new variables.

2009-07-30  Michael Johnson <m.johnson@opendap.org>
